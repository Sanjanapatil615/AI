% dfs/3: DFS from Start to Goal with a list of visited nodes.

dfs(Start, Goal, Path) :-

dfs_helper(Start, Goal, [Start], Path).


% Base case: If Start is the same as Goal, return the path.

dfs_helper(Goal, Goal, Path, Path).


% Recursive case: Explore neighbors of the current node.

dfs_helper(Start, Goal, Visited, Path) :-

edge(Start, Next),

\+ member(Next, Visited), % Avoid cycles by checking if the node is already visited

dfs_helper(Next, Goal, [Next|Visited], Path).



% Example graph edges

edge(a, b).

edge(a, c).

edge(b, d).

edge(b, e).

edge(c, f).

edge(d, g).

edge(e, g).

edge(f, h).




% output command
 dfs(a, g, Path).
